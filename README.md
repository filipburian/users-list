# Wonderful Users List App

Just start it and see the unlimited possibilities it provides.

## To run the app:
1. Make sure you got node installed
2. Run npm ci
3. Run npm start

### If you want to see if .env works:
    Create .env file in root of the project
    Add REACT_APP_API_DOMAIN=your.api.com
    Now request for users will go to {API_DOMAIN}/users.
    
That's it.

If default port 3000 is already taken, app will ask if open on another one.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
